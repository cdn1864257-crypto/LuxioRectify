# Cookie Audit Report - Luxio Market
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Domain:** luxiomarket.shop  
**Backend:** api.luxiomarket.shop

---

## Executive Summary

This audit identified **2 cookies** currently in use by the Luxio Market application. Both cookies are **essential** for authentication and session management. The implementation follows security best practices with HTTPOnly and Secure flags.

---

## Cookies Detected

### 1. `auth_token` (Essential - Authentication)

**Purpose:** JWT authentication token storage

**Details:**
- **Type:** Essential (Authentication)
- **Lifespan:** 7 days
- **Security Attributes:**
  - `httpOnly: true` ‚úÖ
  - `secure: true` (production) ‚úÖ
  - `sameSite: 'none'` (production) / `'lax'` (development) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - `path: /`

**Contains:**
- User ID
- User email
- Token expiration timestamp

**GDPR Classification:** Essential cookie (can be set without explicit consent per Article 6.1(f))

**Recommendations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider changing `sameSite` from `'none'` to `'strict'` or `'lax'` to improve security
- ‚úÖ Current implementation is secure with HTTPOnly preventing XSS attacks
- ‚úÖ Secure flag ensures HTTPS-only transmission

---

### 2. `connect.sid` (Essential - Session)

**Purpose:** Express session management

**Details:**
- **Type:** Essential (Session Management)

- **Security Attributes:**
  - `httpOnly: true` ‚úÖ
  - `secure: true` (production) ‚úÖ
  - `sameSite: 'none'` (production) / `'lax'` (development) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - `path: /`

**Contains:**
- Session identifier
- CSRF token state

**GDPR Classification:** Essential cookie (can be set without explicit consent per Article 6.1(f))

**Recommendations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider changing `sameSite` from `'none'` to `'strict'` or `'lax'` to improve security
- ‚úÖ Current implementation is secure with HTTPOnly preventing XSS attacks

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Application Functionality Without Non-Essential Cookies
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED  
**Details:** No non-essential cookies detected. Both cookies are required for core functionality.

### Test 2: Cookie Security Attributes
**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL  
**Details:**
- HTTPOnly: ‚úÖ All cookies are HTTPOnly
- Secure: ‚úÖ All cookies use Secure in production
- SameSite: ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses 'none' in production for cross-domain support

### Test 3: Cookie Deletion on Logout
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED  
**Details:** Both `auth_token` and `connect.sid` are properly cleared on logout with maxAge: 0

---

## Additional Cookies Scan

Scanned for:
- Analytics cookies (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)
- Marketing cookies
- Tracking pixels
- Third-party cookies

**Result:** ‚ùå None found

---

## Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Minimal cookie footprint** - Only 2 essential cookies
2. **HTTPOnly flags** - Protects against XSS attacks
3. **Secure flags** - Ensures HTTPS-only transmission in production
4. **Proper logout handling** - Cookies are cleared correctly
5. **No tracking cookies** - Privacy-friendly approach

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **SameSite attribute** - Currently 'none' in production for cross-domain support
   - Consider 'strict' or 'lax' for better CSRF protection
   - Only use 'none' if truly necessary for cross-domain authentication
2. **No consent banner** - While both cookies are essential, GDPR requires informing users
3. **Cookie policy** - Need a dedicated cookie policy page explaining usage

---

## GDPR Compliance Status

### Current Status: üü° Partially Compliant

**Compliant:**
- ‚úÖ Both cookies are essential for functionality
- ‚úÖ Secure implementation (HTTPOnly, Secure)
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary tracking cookies
- ‚úÖ Cookies are deleted on logout

**Non-Compliant:**
- ‚ùå No cookie consent banner (informational)
- ‚ùå No cookie policy page
- ‚ùå No privacy policy mentioning cookie usage
- ‚ùå No user notification before cookies are set

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Critical - GDPR Compliance)
1. **Add informational cookie banner** 
   - Not for consent (cookies are essential)
   - To inform users about cookie usage
   - Link to detailed cookie policy
   - Multilingual support (EN, FR, ES, IT, PT, HU)

2. **Create cookie policy page**
   - Explain what each cookie does
   - Why they're necessary
   - How long they last
   - How to delete them

3. **Update privacy policy**
   - Add section about cookie usage
   - Explain data processing

### Priority 2 (Security Enhancement)
1. **Review SameSite attribute**
   - If frontend and backend are on same domain, use 'strict' or 'lax'
   - Only use 'none' if cross-domain is absolutely required

2. **Add security headers**
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - Referrer-Policy

3. **Implement JWT refresh tokens**
   - Short-lived access tokens (15-30 min)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Reduces risk of token compromise

### Priority 3 (User Rights - GDPR Article 15-20)
1. **Right to access** - Export personal data
2. **Right to erasure** - Delete account and data
3. **Right to rectification** - Edit personal information
4. **Right to data portability** - Download data in machine-readable format

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Keep Current Implementation + GDPR UI
**Pros:**
- Minimal code changes
- Proven secure implementation
- Essential cookies only

**Cons:**
- Need to add GDPR UI components
- SameSite 'none' may not be optimal

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **Recommended** - This approach maintains security while adding compliance

### Option 2: Move to Server-Side Sessions Only
**Pros:**
- Single session cookie
- No JWT in cookies

**Cons:**
- Requires session storage scaling
- More complex architecture
- May increase server load

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå Not recommended - Current approach is more scalable

### Option 3: localStorage for JWT
**Pros:**
- No cookies for JWT
- Simpler CORS

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- ‚ùå Not GDPR-friendly
- ‚ùå Less secure than HTTPOnly cookies

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå **Not recommended** - Less secure than current implementation

---

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** (This session) - Security headers and cookie banner
2. **Phase 2** - Privacy policy and cookie policy pages
3. **Phase 3** - User data rights (export, delete)
4. **Phase 4** - Final compliance audit

---

## Files Modified for Cookie Management

- `server/index-render.ts` - Production server with session config
- `server/index.ts` - Development server with session config
- `api/auth/signup.ts` - Sets auth_token cookie on signup
- `api/auth/login.ts` - Sets auth_token cookie on login
- `api/auth/logout.ts` - Clears both cookies on logout
- `api/auth/me.ts` - Reads auth_token for authentication

---

## Conclusion

Luxio Market uses a **minimal, secure cookie implementation** with only 2 essential cookies. The implementation follows security best practices (HTTPOnly, Secure flags) but lacks GDPR-mandated user-facing features like consent banners and policy pages.

**Next Steps:**
1. Add informational cookie banner with multilingual support
2. Create privacy policy and cookie policy pages
3. Implement user data rights (export, delete account)
4. Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
5. Generate final GDPR compliance report

**Auditor Note:** This is a preliminary audit. Final compliance should be verified by legal counsel familiar with GDPR requirements for your specific jurisdiction and use case.
